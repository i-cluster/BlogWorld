# BlogWorld

This is the BlogWorld Repository created to offer source code access to students taking my Django 1.11 lecture in 2018 Winter.

## About Me

I am KeonSunKim. Graduated Sogang University Bachelor Program with an Economics and Sociology Degree. 
<br>
Currently undergoing my Masters Program in Sogang University Sociology Department. I also work at a startup "Greedy Turtles" in Seoul, Korea as a backend web developer.

If you want to contact me, contact me through my email given in my course plan.

## Before Getting Started

My course is mainly based for programmers with entry level, and intermediate level understanding of Django. The course was mainly offered to students in CEOS, a startup network for university students in Seoul. This course was offered with the purpose of donating talent, and this is my first attempt at teaching Django 1.11. Be merciful!
